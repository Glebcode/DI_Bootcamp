Python is well-known within the programming sphere as being 
deceptively easy to learn and understand. This is due
to a combination of factors, primary among which is the
considerable practical ease of usage, as it requires 
fewer lines of code to do more, as compared to its more 
traditional counterparts. This usability has allowed some
of the biggest websites to be developed with this language.
